I want to optimize the UI for my notifications center view controller. this is how it looks currently. I want to do the following changes : abandon the "mark all read" and "delete all" buttons that are at the top of the screen. 2- apply the clear all functionality at the button that is at the bottom of the screen 3- put a small button with an icon slightly above the tableview designed as a "mark all read". 4- make all table view cells visible and fix constraints 5- if the notification is not read, then the cell border will be the primary color of the app .primary
